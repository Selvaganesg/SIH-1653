SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
You can develop an AI-powered interview assessment system that replicates a real-life boardroom experience, ensuring fairness and objectivity in candidate evaluation. The system would generate role-specific questions dynamically, starting with ice-breaking queries before progressing to more technical and managerial questions based on the candidate’s expertise.

AI would analyze candidate responses in real-time, evaluating them based on relevance, depth, accuracy, and confidence. The system would also assess the quality of interviewers’ questions to ensure fairness and objectivity. A scoring mechanism would provide quantifiable results for both candidates and interviewers, helping the expert panel make informed hiring decisions.

The platform could feature a dashboard for panel members to review AI-generated scores, adjust weightage, and track candidate performance. Additional functionalities such as speech-to-text processing, sentiment analysis, and automated report generation could enhance the overall experience. The system could integrate with DRDO’s recruitment database, ensuring a seamless selection process while minimizing bias and improving efficiency.
